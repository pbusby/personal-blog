Here's what I've learned this week:

<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>First thing</li>
  <li>Second thing</li>
  <li>Last thing</li>

Here's a quote from one of my favorite authors:

> “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”
> -Shakespeare
